# Receipt Reader

This will be an app that photographs receipts and uses the Google Vision API to read the text. It will then parse the response to find vendor and amount information.

This is part of my ongoing effort to improve [SplittR](https://github.com/caitp222/splittr-frontend), my Dev Bootcamp final project.
